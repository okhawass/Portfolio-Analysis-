# Portfolio-Analysis-
Assigned 25 companies in which I extract their data using pandas_datareader and conduct a ton of analysis such as calculating the Alpha, Beta, R2, Treynor and Sharpe Ratio of the portfolios returns. I've also included some data visualizations along with result tables and exported them into an Excel file.

The Instructions for this project can be viewed in the 'Portfolio Analysis Instructions' PDF file. 
The output of the code returns an Excel File containing many sheets with tables and graphs that summarize the results of the analysis.
